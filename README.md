Welcome! In this project i hade to make a webshop. The users have to register, if they want to buy some product.
ONLY ADMIN can add products, update products or delete product. 
The users can watch the products, choose one and watch it closer and add to cart. Later they have to check out to make an order of the products what they want to buy.

GETTING STARTED/DOWNLOADS
DATABASE: The project is connected to a database. You will find it in the files if you download the project from 
https://github.com/Szilveszter98/InduviduellaPHP

CODE RULES & BUILD UP

All php-function for the website are in the folder called "objects". The functions are in classes for users, posts(products) and carts.
In v1 you will find all the files where I use the functions and the files can be uppdates later easily.

In some places i use $_GET to send the token and IDÂ´s to other pages because i dont have any frontend in this project and i wanted it to look good.
I write my variables and functions with CamelCase,
In the Database i use underscore to the names of the collum.

This project was built with Visual Studio Code and phpMyAdmin and saved in Github
